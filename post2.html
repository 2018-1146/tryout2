This dormant volcano is situated between the province of Davao del Sur and Northern Cotabato, this park is blessed with geysers, hot springs, surfur pillars, lakes, rivers and water falls. It serves as a dwelling place for 629 species of flora and numerous species of fauna. Some of the plants that can be found in the area are the 148 families of vascular and non vascular plants, and the 124 families of ferns, angiosperms and the others are species belonging to families of bryophytes. The diversity of faunas includes 227 vertebrates with 69 families of amphibians and 118 species of butterflies. </p>
     
          <h2>Why do we travel here?</h2>
          <p>The mountain serves as a bird sanctuary. There are falconet, mynah, Philippine eagle (Philippine National Bird), white-browed shortwing, the Philippine trogon, the yellow-bellied whistler, the island flycatcher, and little pied flychatcher which can also be found in some parts of Luzon and in Palawan. Also seen in the area are birds that exist in the highlands of Luzon such as strong-billed shrike, strong-billed shrike, the Philippine bullfinch, skull of white-cheeked bullfinch.

          <br><p>Mt. Apo serves as a dwelling place for butterflies. There is an abundance of butterflies in the are: the grass yellow butterfly, blue triangle butterfly, day butterfly, tailed jay butterfly as well as the five endemic species of butterflies: Father schoenig’s chocolate or Parantica schoenigi; Delias lecicki; D. schoenigi; D. apoensis; and D. woodi. Also dwells here are bats, civet cats, deer, rats, squirrels, ungulates, shrews, and gymnures. There are also four endemic animals here: These are Mindanao montane forest mouse; Philippine tree shrew; Philippine tree squirrel; Mindanao gymnure or Mindanao moonrat, and the Philippine gymnure, which belongs to family hedgehogs. Philippine deer is the most threatened mammal in the area.

            Numerous varieties of reptiles and amphibians are present in the forest. Some of the reptiles that found in the area are the burrowing skinks of the genus Brachymeles, the Cuming’s eared skink, the family of Lygosoma, which is rare to find and water monitor lizard.
            
            Number of frog species are also present which include the Philippine woodland frog (an endangered species), the broad hearted forest frog, the horned forest frog, pelobaticd frog, the Mueller’s toad, the Mindanao toad, flatheaded frog, the montane narrow-mouthed frog. Due to the scarcity of freshwater the population of these species increases slowly. Being the center of endemism in Mindanao it is a must to protect and preserve this park.</p>
       
          <h2>How to get to Mt. Apo?</h2>
          <p>Davao is well connected to both Manila and Cebu City, the two busiest international airports in the Philippines. Cebu Pacific Air, the local low-cost carrier with a new and modern fleet, offer cheap daily flights from both Manila and Cebu starting at less than 2000 pesos (one-way). I flied from Cebu City and paid 2500 pesos (one-way), and back to Cebu City for 1800 pesos only (one-way).</p>
          <br><p>One can either stay a night in Davao City or go directly to Santa Cruz (45 km southwest of Davao), where a permit and guide/porter for Mount Apo must be arranged. After arriving Davao International Airport, try to avoid the taxi-touts at the entrance/exit who will try to charge 1500 pesos for a ride to Santa Cruz. Walk instead 50 metres from the terminal, where the white or yellow metred-taxis are. Here you can easily negotiate a price of 600-700 pesos. If you are on a really tight budget it will be even cheaper to commute like described below (total 207 pesos):</p>
            <br><p>
              1. After arriving at Davao International Airport, ride a taxi to Ecoland Transport Terminal (travel time 20 minutes - 150 pesos)</p>
              <br><p>2. At Ecoland Terminal, look for south-bound buses such as yellow bus, weena bus, ACFB or Metro Shuttle and ask the driver or the conductor that you will be dropped off at Santa Cruz Terminal (travel time 45 minutes to 1 hour - 43 pesos).
              </p>
              <br><p>3. At Santa Cruz Terminal, take a motorcycle or tricycle taxi to the municipal hall, Tourism Office (travel time 5 minutes - 14 pesos)

                KapataganTo get from Santa Cruz to the trailhead in Baruring you can hire a jeep for 800 pesos or commute. The latter would be cheaper, 3 persons would cost 400+ pesos, but the time-frame would be more uncertain. While a jeep will take 1-1.5 hours to the trailhead in Baruring, commuting will take at least 2-3 hours depending on availability/departure of share-taxis, motorcycle taxis etc. First you need a bus from Santa Cruz to Digos, then a shared van/taxi from Digos to Kapatagan, and finally a motorcycle-taxi from Kapatagan to Baruring. This will be quite complicated and time-consuming, but at least you have your guide to take care of this.</p>
